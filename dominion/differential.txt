For my testing purposes, I used the dominion implementation of Paul Lantow,
which you can find at:
https://github.com/cs362sp16/cs362sp16_lantowp/tree/master/dominion

I placed Paul's implementation in a subfolder of my project,
at lantowp_dominion. After doing this, I ran my diffdominion.py like so:

  python diffdominion.py . lantowp_dominion 42

The . being my current dominion directory, and the 42 being the starting seed.
With the seed of 42, I saw no difference between implementations. I got this
output after both out1 and ou2 were compared:

  LENGTH /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out1 353
  LENGTH /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out2 353

With out1 being my dominion implementation and out2 being Paul's.

The coverage for this run was 50.57% for my imlementation and 46.46% for Paul's
implementation.

It wasn't until I tried out a seed of 512 that I got anything close to a
difference in output.

  LENGTH /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out1 395
  LENGTH /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out2 784
  MISMATCH AT LINE 83
  /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out1 Player 3 Gold: 3
  /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out2 Player 3 Gold: 4
  PRIOR TO DIVERGENCE:
  /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out1 Remodel played.
  /Users/christianmello/Code/cs362sp16_melloc/dominion/out2 Remodel played.

After that divergence, my unix diff of the two files couldn't be more different.

Seeing that these two implementations have different outputs should, in theory,
be helpful in figuring out the one that has bugs, but in reality, there is know
way to tell offhand which implementation of dominion here has the correct
implementation. This is absolutely not an ideal case in differential testing.

As far as coverage goes for this run, the 512 seed run of dominion got 48.08% for me and
46.31% for Paul's implementation.

Sadly, I wasn't able to get the full 60% coverage in any test that I ran and
documented. Better luck next time I guess.
