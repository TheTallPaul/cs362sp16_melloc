I found an innumerable amount of bugs when doing my unit tests in this
assignment. As it turns out, the myassert function from asimpleunittest.c works
in a way I didn't entirely comprehend, and all of my asserts failed on the card
unit tests. This includes ones I didn't deliberately add bugs to. On the
regular function unit tests, everything came out fine but the isGameOver
function, which somehow returned a game over on the initialized game.
