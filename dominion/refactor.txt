I started by creating separate files, cardEffects.c and cardEffects.h, and properly
adding the 5 functions into the files. I looked at dominion.c's cardEfect function,
cut the 5 cards I would use from each case, and pasted them individually into the
separate functions in cardEffects.c. In each function's signature, I made sure to
include the variables from dominion.c that the functions would need, and added calls 
to the new;y created functions in dominion.c, passing variables from one place to
another.
