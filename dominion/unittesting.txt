All in all, I discovered doing this assignment that unit testing itself requires
just as much if not more concerted effort than actually writing the initial
code. I didn't spend near enough time creating and testing the tests, so almost
all of the hours I spent working on unit testing plumb failed. I'm going to
work hard to take what I learned from this assignment and apply it to having a
much better rest of my term.
